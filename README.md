# TwoThreeFourSet
This implementation of a `TwoThreeFourTree` was done as a homework
project in the 4th semester at the `University of Applied Sciences in Hagenberg`.

The full explanation of what each bit of code does can be found under
`src/two-three-four-set/idea`, it is written in German. I might add an
English version to the `README` in the future.
